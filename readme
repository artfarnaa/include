Loki was the Norse trickster god. He was the son of the frost giant Farbauti and the giantess Laufey (also known as Nal).
Loki was a mischevious god, constantly tricking and swiching sides in every conflict. Eventually he became so
much trouble that the gods imprisoned Loki in a cave until Ragnarok.
Loki had three famous (but monstrous) children with the frost giantess Angrboda: Fenrir, Jourmungand and Hel. He also was the father
of Narfi with his wife, the goddess Sigyn. With a stallion named Svaoilfari, Loki also gave birth himself to the eight-legged horse Sleipnir.
